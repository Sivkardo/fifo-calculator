# FIFO Calculator

## Requirements

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download needed packages.

## Arguments

* `-g`, `--generate`: Generates CSV file from provided excel file (generated file is formatted for FIFO app input).
* `-c`, `--concatenate`: Concatenates multiple csv files into a single file. Used if user has multiple CSV files which he wants to concatenate.
* `-s`, `--sheet`: Single or multiple sheet names from provided excel file. Make sure the order of sheets corresponds to header row index number.
* `-i`, `--index`: Row index or indices of transaction header in excel file. Make sure the order of indices corresponds to sheet names.
* `-e`, `--excel`: Path to excel file.
* `-v`, `--csv`: Path(s) to csv file(s). Make sure the order in which the files are provided is chronological.
* `-o`, `--output`: Name of output CSV file. If the output name is not provided, a timestamp will be used instead.
* `-t`, `--temporary`: Keep temporary files (CSV files that are concatenated into the final file).
* `-u`, `--unspent`: Calculates unspent tokens received from interest (takes FIFO output as input file).

## Usage

* Run the program by running the `main.py` script with arbitrary arguments.
* The program has 3 main usages:
  * generating CSV files from provided excel file: `-g` argument
  * concatenating CSV files: `-c` argument (can also be used with `-g`)
  * calculating unspent tokens received from interest: `-u` argument

## Examples

* `python3 main.py -g -e data.xlsx -s 2023 2024 -r 1 14 -c`
* In the above line, with `-g` we tell the program we only want to generate a CSV file(s) from provided excel file.
The program will generate 3 CSV files in this instance, one for each sheet and finally a concatenated file because the flag `-c` was used.
* `python main.py -c -v file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv -o joined`
* In the above line, since only the `-c` argument is given, the program will concatenate the given files `-v file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv` and create
output file `joined.csv`.
